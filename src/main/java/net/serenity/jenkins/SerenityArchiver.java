 * A Publisher plugin for Jenkins which publishes the Serenity test reports from the latest build

 * reports were produced in a previous build step, e.g. by running the maven-failsafe-plugin and the
 * maven-serenity-plugin in a Maven build.
 * <p>
 * The report directory (relative to this project's workspace folder) must be defined on the Jenkins
 * project configuration page.
 * <p>
 * This class has a config.jelly with a validation method in {@link SerenityArchiverDescriptor}.
